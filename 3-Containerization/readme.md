- The author did surveys to identify the challenges of the containerization like performance,orchestration and security
  - Most of the responses where about cloud computing which is where we have more adoption of these technologies
  - The author says we must have more work towards using containerization in clusters
- Overview
  - `Virtualization`
    - Isolation layer built on top of the operating system level
    - There are 2 types of virtualization: para-virtualization and full-virtualization
      - Para-virtualization
        - Communication between the guest operating system and the hypervisor
      - Full-virtualization
        - Deploy virtual machines with full isolation from the operating system level
    - This was important for cloud computing,systems and data centers
    - Contariners are the alternative virtualization
      - It is more light
      - It abstracts the current OS level
      - It has lower start-up time compared to VMS
      - It enhances resource utilization because it uses fewer
      - They can reach near native performance when tested against bar metal execution (bar-metal means there is a operating system and apps run directly over the hardware, it does not have virtualization involved)
      - They remove some of the disadvantages of non-containerized virtualization like hypervisor dependency just-in-time compilation,performance degradation and slow booting times
      - They are more beneficial than virtual machines
      - Performance ehnances by about 50%
      - Provides isolation with namespaces and cgroups
      - They can secure the run-time environment for apps and network resources management
  - Container technologies
    - Docker
      - Lightweight container based virtualization
      - Sharing the same operating system among containers
      - Provides methods for security level, by using namespaces and Cgroups mechanisms
      - Namespaces: user,net,PID,mnt,Cgroup,time,etc...
    - Singularity
      - Create and deploy execution environments for computational science
      - Similar to docker
      - Containers as files
    - uDocker
      - The same as docker but it does not require root privileges to run
      - Suitable for cloud computing
      - More secure because it does not run as root
  - Architecture changed from software components oriented architecture to service-oriented architecture
  - Now we are in a non-monolitic app trend
  - Container lifecycle
    - Paused,killed and stopped
- Container orchestration
  - Useful for managing containers
  - Provides performance,isolation,scalability,portability,dependency,fault-tolerance and load balancing
  - `Docker Swarm`
    - Native docker orchestrator
    - We can run multiple containers across a cluster
    - Supports rolling updates,auto recovery services and security mechanisms
  - `Mesos`
    - Linux kernel principles
    - Container orchestrator
    - Does not support service discovery
    - Supports load balancing
    - Ideal to run spark,kafka,hadoop,elastic search
  - `Kubernetes`
    - Same as Mesos but supports service descovery but the architecture is different
    - It uses Master nodes,workers and pods for its logic
    - Uses basic monitoring,logging and health checking
    - We can use a service mesh like istio to make it even more traceable
  - `Nextflow`
    - Workflow management system designed for data-driven computation pipelines
- Classification for the orchestrartion system
  - Application layer
    - Container configs related to networking,availability,load balancing and service discovery
  - Container orchestration layer
    - Orchestration functionalities
  - Computing infrastructure
    - Physical level, composed of machines to manage computing processing
- `Applications of containerization`
  - Scientific Computing
    - Life sciences
    - Artificial inteligence
    - Machine learning
    - It is used to a huge amount of intensive tasks as well as intensive data apps
    - This is because it requires lots of parallel scientific computing
  - Big data processing
    - Handling data intensive apps that require frameworks and sophisticated programming models to handle mass of data in a reasonable amount of time
    - Big data analytics
    - Distributed processing
    - Monitoring services
    - security
    - IoT
    - It requires MPI libraries, GPUs and field-programmable gate array (FPGA)
    - Provides scheduling of containerized jobs to speed up the analytics tasks
  - High performance computing
  - Grid Computing
    - Multi-institutional research communities
    - Virtual organizations
    - Computing for research
  - High throughput computing HTC
    - High throughput computing is another category that requires lots of computing power
  - Cloud computing
  - IoT
  - Fog and edge computing
    - Fog computing stands for heterogeneous nodes like devices, gateways and computers
    - Those are devices that are on the edge of the network
  - Devops
- Performance metrics of containerization
  - Computing performance
    - CPU,Memory throughput and DISK I/O resources
    - Number of operations,completion time 
    - CPU performance is better in containers vs virtual machines and almost the same as native performance
    - Performance is better in containers than the virtual machines
    - Lowest power consumption and the lower throughput
    - Better performance for big data processing containers
    - Low overhead of cpu and memory containers
    - better scalability also containers
  - Isolation performance
    - Better performance in the deployment of micro-services in separate containers
    - Kubernetes was supperior to other orchestrator platforms
  - Network performance
    - Docker container is the most appropriate solution in terms of response time,CPU utilization and memory usage
    - Low overhead and rapid deployment at a large scale
