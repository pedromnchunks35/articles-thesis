# Notes
- Blockchain is so emerging that we needed to create solutions without having the standards
- Protecting information is more relevant than ever
- This article is about the standarization in the blockchain overview and organizations publications about blockchains/distributed ledger technologies
- Lack of standarization in the DLT(Distributed ledger technology) is one of the main reasons for the tech not getting evolution in terms of everyday usage
- Rating agency Moody's experts believe that standarization will accelarate the process of technology implementation,reduce transaction costs,level out regulatory risks,improve intereoperability of systems and improve quality interaction between market participants and increase attractiveness of securing assets on a blockchain
- Standarization is a important step for interoperability,scaling,auditing and possible further regulation of the tech
- Blockchain technologies standarization is of very interest to China
- Organizatons such as IEEE are well known for providing technical standarization
- Iso 27k series are the best for information security
- A Standardized framework will allow objective information security auditing of blockchain system on a larger scale
- In this document non oficial standards are not considered a standard (ex: Ethereum tokens standards is not a standard since it is business driven and not a universal standard)
- In this article no standards without beeing in their final form were considered
- GDPR compliance
- In 2018, NIST published the document NISTIR 8202 - Blockchain Technology Overview
  - Speaks about fundamental functionalities and components of a blockchain

  - It contains a number of blockchain specific problems and considerations
- In 2018 ASC X9 released a final version of Distributed Ledger and Blockchain Technology Study Group Report
  - It discusses what standarization would be required for financial sectors but also other insdustries
  - It focuses on permissioned blockchains
  - It has 3 levels of urgency to have standards over that matter (high,medium or low)
  - It focuses on explaning security needs and issues of blockchain, specially for finance
  - They recommend that there is a 3 stage approach of checking non-blockchain standards that cover the same topic, using incremental improvements for blockchain specific implementations and as a third, checking out which areas required urgent standarization
  - There is a high-level reference architecture included in the appendix to explain how DLT system works
  - Its just a report to declare which areas require more standarization, it does not provide direct value in terms of standarization

  - It is very good for smart contracts, not only the technical functionality but also a generous amount of use cases

    - It explains the roles in licensing operations
    - It gives a overview of how a proposed system could look like
  - DIN SPEC 4997: The specification Privacy by Blockchain Design: Standarized model for processing personal data using blockchain

  - The components include consensus protocols,sidechains,smartcontracts and cryptography
  - They have one section of the report for cybersecurity challenges, both traditional and technology specific
